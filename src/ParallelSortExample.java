/*
Java 8 introduced a new method called as parallelSort() in java.util.Arrays Class. It uses Parallel Sorting of array elements

Algorithm of parallelSort()

1. The array is divided into sub-arrays and that
   sub-arrays is again divided into their sub-arrays,
   until the minimum level of detail in a set of array.
2. Arrays are sorted individually by multiple thread.
3. The parallel sort uses Fork/Join Concept for sorting.
4. Sorted sub-arrays are then merged.

Syntax :

For sorting data in ascending order :
public static void parallelSort(Object obj[])
For sorting data in specified range in ascending order :
public static void parallelSort(Object obj[], int from, int to)

Advantage :
parallelSort() method uses concept of MultiThreading which makes the sorting faster as compared to normal sorting method.


1) Arrays.sort() : is a sequential sorting.


The API uses single thread for the operation.
It takes bit longer time to perform the operation.
2. Arrays.ParallelSort() : is a parallel sorting.

The API uses multiple threads for the operation.
Itâ€™s faster when there are a lot of elements whereas slower for lesser elements.
Analysis : The results show that parallel sorting on a multicore machine can achieve performance improvements at 1 million or more elements.
This result meets the expectation, and the suitable size here may be 1 million.
Your mileage may vary, it depends on your environment.
